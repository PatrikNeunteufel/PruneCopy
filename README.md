# PruneCopy

**Selective file copier for developers.**  
A powerful CLI utility for pattern-based file copying and filtering – ideal for post-build tasks and deployment preparation.

the idea for this tool was born out of the need to copy only specific files from a source directory to a target directory, while excluding certain directories and files based on patterns. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to prepare a subset of files for deployment or distribution, such as copying only header files or excluding implementation files. e.g. the includes to use a dll does not need the implementation files as `*Impl.hpp`.

The tool is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to customize the file selection process according to their specific needs.
